# text-mining

For my project, I downloaded Volume I of the History of the United State through Project Gutenberg. Given the special politcal climate of our world today, I was intruiged to go back to my AP US History days and get a crash course on the wars in the US. I analyzed the textbook to pull out specific major wars that occured: I will search certain key words like war, conflict, conference, meeting, etc to identify the sentence that includes such key words.
